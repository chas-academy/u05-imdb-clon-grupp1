### Built With

* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
* [AWS s3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)

### Code Standards
* [Psr-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md)

## Goals and Context
Our goal is to create a competent and smart website that gathers all relevant information about, and around movies.

### Project Solves?
At present, information about movies and managing lists of movies that one would like to see is too cumbersome for many competitors. By creating a more user-focused experience, this process can be facilitated and thus attract more visitors. With an increased interest in the service can also publish and administer film content

### Our Vision?
By creating a modern user experience, there is the opportunity to enter the market and thus get a large number of users. This in turn can in the long run create opportunities for advertising campaigns from various stakeholders such as product companies that offer sales of film-related products as well as service providers who may be interested in behavioral patterns and trends. Creating an exceptional experience, on mobile as well as in the browser can potentially create a viral reception of users.

## User Personas

| Data        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Usertype    | David Hult |
| Name        | Active User  |

## User Stories

### Website Users
As a Website User, I am busy and have little time to find information about movies. I want to be able to find information about movies quickly and painlessly. Ideally with as few clicks as possible.

As a Website User, finding the correct movie is vital. I want to see different results of movies in a clear and concise manner so that I can easily know which movies I should watch, or learn more about.

###    Website Registered Users
As a Registered Website User, I am concerned with keeping track of what movies I want to watch, what movies Iâ€™m reviewing, have reviewed or am planning to review. I want to have the possibility to manage several lists of movies I want to watch, as well as movies I am currently reviewing or have planned to review.

### Website Admin
As a Admin, I want to be able to add new movies and information about movies in a ordered way. I need to have the possibility to separate movies into different categories and provide additional metadata about each movie, as well as linking them to actors, directors and so on.

As a Admin, I want to be able to track what users of the website are doing in terms of reviewing movies and putting in their watchlists. Iâ€™d also want to be able to grant and remove roles to different users, granting them access to specific functionality as either an admin or restricting them to a regular user.
